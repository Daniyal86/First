B) Consider the given relational table:
employee(empno , empname, designation, city, salary, zipcode, county)
1. Creates a sequence used to generate employee numbers for the empno column of the emp table.
2. Create an Index on county.
3. Create a view for employees having salary <50000
and stays in ‘Mumbai’
==>
CREATE TABLE employee1 (
    empno INT,
    empname VARCHAR(255),
    designation VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(255),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    zipcode VARCHAR(10),
    counrty VARCHAR(255)
);

1.Creates a sequence used to generate employee numbers for the empno column of the emp table.
 	   CREATE SEQUENCE empno_sequence
 	   START WITH 1
  	   INCREMENT BY 1
  	   NOCACHE
   	   NOCYCLE;

2.Create an Index on county.
   CREATE INDEX idx_county ON employee(county);

3.Create a view for employees having salary <50000 and stays in ‘Mumbai’.
CREATE VIEW low_salary_mumbai_employees AS
SELECT empno, empname, designation, city, salary, zipcode, county
